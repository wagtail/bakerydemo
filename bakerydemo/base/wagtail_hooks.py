N.B. To see what icons are available for use in Wagtail menus and StreamField block types,
enable the styleguide in settings:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
   ...
   'wagtail.contrib.styleguide',
   ...
)

or see http://kave.github.io/general/2015/12/06/wagtail-streamfield-icons.html

This demo project includes the full font-awesome set via CDN in base.html, so the entire
font-awesome icon set is available to you. Options are at http://fontawesome.io/icons/.
